## Deployments 
### Heroku 
The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - First, you must log into Heroku and go into the deploy tab. 
  
  - From here, you go to the Config Vars section. 
  
  - You then enter Key: PORT and Value: 8000. If you have a google sheet installed you will need to enter the data here too. 
  
  - You must then go to the buildpacks section. Here you add Python and Nodejs. The must be in the order of python on top, and Nodejs underneath. 
  
  - After finishing the above you will go to the 'Deploy' tab. 
  
  - You then connect to your Github account. 
  
  - Once you enter your repository name, your Github project will be connected to Heroku. 
  
  - From here you have two options to deploy. You can select the option to enable automatic deploys, so when you commit any changes will automatically deploy. 
  
  - The second option is to manually deploy, this is what I personally chose. When you click the 'Deploy' button, you will watch your files being uploaded. 
  
  -   Once this is complete, a sucess message will appear with a 'View' button that will bring you to the deployed project.
